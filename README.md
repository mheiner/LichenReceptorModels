# LichenReceptorModels

Example code to fit Bayesian multivariate receptor models presented in "Multivariate Receptor Modeling with Widely Dispersed Lichens as Bioindicators of Air Quality" by Heiner, Grimm, Smith, Leavitt, Christensen, Carling, and St. Clair.

## Folders

**data**: Contains `rhizoplaca96.csv` with raw lichen elemental data.

**helperScripts**: R scripts that support the analysis including prior specification of pollutant-source profiles, simulation from the profile priors, and elemental detection limits.

**plots**: Empty folder to collect plots generated by analysis.

**postsim**: Empty folder to collect MCMC output.

## Analysis scripts
R scripts that comprise the primary analysis workflow are named with ordered numeric prefixes. Each should be run interactively. `2_analyze_results.R` has commented options whose use is dictated by the specific model run (i.e., base or sparse).
